    "The goal of the Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction contest is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the poverty level of households using both individual and household characteristics. Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given the right amount of aid, and it’s especially tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. The world’s poorest typically can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.  Costa Rica is just one of many countries that faces this same problem of assessing social need.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will do our best to come up with a complete machine learning solution to this problem. First, we will get introduced to the problem, then explore the dataset, clean the dataset, work on feature engineering, try out multiple machine learning models, select a model, work to optimize the model, and finally, inspect the outputs of the model and draw conclusions."

    "The data for this competition is provided in a training set file and a test set file: `train.csv` and `test.csv`. The training set has 9557 rows and 143 columns, and the testing set has 23856 rows and 142 columns. Each row represents one individual and each column is a feature, either unique to the individual, or for the household of that individual. The training set has one additional column, `Target`, which represents the poverty level on a scale from 1-4. A value of 1 is the most extreme poverty, while a value of 4 represents non vulnerable households. This is a multi-class classification machine learning problem with 4 classes."

In order to create a dataset for the task, we'll have to perform some aggregations of the individual data for each household. Moreover, we have to make a prediction for every individual in the test set, but \"ONLY the heads of household are used in scoring\" which means we want to predict poverty on a household basis."
